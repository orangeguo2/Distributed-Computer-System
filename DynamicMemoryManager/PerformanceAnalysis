 Whether the order of free nodes on the free list makes a difference?
 It will make a difference. Order by memory address can facilitate the coalesce and make it easy.
 While if we order the free node by its size, 
 it will facilitate the "looking for block to allocate" process, especially for "Best fit algorithm". 
 But it will make more complicate about coalesce.
 
Although it is not clear on short1, the performance does improve when processing all traces files.
